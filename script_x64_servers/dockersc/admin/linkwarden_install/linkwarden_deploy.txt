Download the required files
mkdir linkwarden && cd linkwarden
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linkwarden/linkwarden/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linkwarden/linkwarden/refs/heads/main/.env.sample -o ".env"


2. Configure the Environment Variables
nano .env

The required environment variables are:

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=VERY_SENSITIVE_SECRET
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=CUSTOM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD

The only thing you MUST change here is NEXTAUTH_SECRET and POSTGRES_PASSWORD, 
they both should be different secret phrases.

The NEXTAUTH_URL should be changed to your domain name only if you are hosting it somewhere else.

3. Run it!
In the main folder (where you created the .env file) simply run the following:

docker compose up

After a few minutes (depending on your internet connection) you can access Linkwarden via http://localhost:3000 
(or whichever hostname you deployed Linkwarden on).
